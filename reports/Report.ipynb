    "Mathematical morphology provides powerful tools for extracting and enhancing image structures.  \n",
    "Two fundamental compound operations are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Opening** – erosion followed by dilation.  \n",
    "  Removes small bright noise and separates weakly connected objects.  \n",
    "- **Closing** – dilation followed by erosion.  \n",
    "  Fills small dark holes and connects broken parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both operations preserve the overall shape and size of objects while suppressing unwanted details.\n",

    "**Objectives**  \n",
    "- Understand the mathematical formulation of erosion, dilation, opening, closing.  \n",
    "- Implement the operations with adjustable structuring elements using OpenCV.  \n",
    "- Visualise and compare the effects on noisy and fragmented binary images.  \n",
    "- Discuss real‑world applications and limitations."
